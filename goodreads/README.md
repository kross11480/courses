The repository contains jupyter notebook for analysing book ratings for 10000 most popular (i.e. with most ratings) books in Goodreads. The major aim is to find out how classics authors book ratings compare with popular books.

For the analysis, a dataset has been cloned from [releases](https://github.com/zygmuntz/goodbooks-10k/releases). The Dataset contains
* ratings.csv: six million ratings (book_id, user_id, rating) for 10,000 popular books.
* books.csv: Information (icluding authors, title, avg_ratings, ...) on ten thousand most popular (with most ratings) books.
* classics.csv: Information on around 200 classics books.

Try out the [jupyter notebook](book_analysis.ipynb) for the analysis of the dataset.
